# VideoAnalysis
A video analysis software is a user program that is installed on surveillance cameras to review video footage that has already been captured. It evaluates the visual coverage into fine details that are crucial to the user. The technician in charge of a place like a business premise sets specific parameters that the Video Analytics Software will analyze. For instance, in a supermarket, you may set detection of strange movements of customers that would suggest shoplifting and unusual engagement with a cashier. The analytics software can be used for facial recognition, motion detection, queue monitoring, reading license plate, and unlimited personalized suggestions.
